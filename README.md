This work is part of the Machine Learning and Statistic module and it is available in https://github.com/PepeAlex/Project-_Power . Our goal was to create a web service using machine learning to manipulate data and predict results.

Following the requirement, I created an application on Jupyter Notebook in which I extract the data and manipulate it using some of the libraries listed below:

        - pandas - for data manipulation and analysis.
    
        - matplotlib - for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
    
        - scipy - for scientific computing and technical computing.
    
        - numpy - for comprehensive mathematical functions, random number generators, linear algebra routines, Fourier transforms, and more.
    
        - tensorflow - for fast numerical computing created and released by Google.
    
        - sklearn - for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.
    
        - joblib -  a set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in Python.
    
Within Jupyter I created two models of machine learning, one for Linear Regression and one for Neural Network.

In this step I used the flash to create a web application and ran the flask inside the virtual environment.
